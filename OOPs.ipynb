    "2. Multiple Inheritance : \n",
    "If a class is able to be created from multiple base classes, this kind of Inheritance is known as multiple Inheritance. When there is multiple Inheritance, each of the attributes that are present in the classes of the base has been passed on to the class that is derived from it.\n",

    "The features that are part of the original class, as well as the class that is derived from it, are passed on to the new class. It is similar to a relationship involving grandparents and children.\n",

    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance : \n",
