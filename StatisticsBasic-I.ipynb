    "Q1. What is Statistics ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Statistics is the science of collecting , organinzing and analyzing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A] Descriptive Statistics : consists of organizing and summarizzing data. \n",
    "     Eg. To find average (mean) of heights of students in the class.\n",
    "     B] Inferential Statistics : consists of using data you have measured to from conclusion.\n",
    "     Eg. Exit poll of Elections \n",
    "     \n",
    "Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of\n",
    "    each type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. a] Quantitative data : this type consist the data that is in the numerical format. \n",
    "        i) Discrete : this type of quantitative data consists of whole nos only \n",
    "            eg : No. students in the classroom \n",
    "        ii) Continuos : this type of quantitative data consists of all kinds of numerical value . \n",
    "            eg : Weights of students in classroom\n",
    "     b] Oualitative data : this type consist the data that is in the categorical format \n",
    "         i) Nominal data : No ranking is done in this kind of data just they are categorized\n",
    "             eg : gender \n",
    "         ii) Ordinal data : Ranking is done in this kind of data and categorized according to rank. \n",
    "             eg : toppers of class. \n",
    "             \n",
    "Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:\n",
    "    (i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E\n",
    "    (ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red\n",
    "    (iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...]\n",
    "    (iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans. i) Ordinal data \n",
    "     ii) Nominal \n",
    "     iii) Continuos data \n",
    "     iv) Discrete data \n",
    "     \n",
    "Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Levels of measurement tell you how precisely variables are recorded.\n",
    "        types : a] Nominal scale data : the data can only be categorized\n",
    "                    eg: gender \n",
    "                b] Ordinal scale data : the data can be categorized and ranked\n",
    "                    eg: Race \n",
    "                c] Interval scale data : the data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced\n",
    "                    eg: Temprature\n",
    "                d] Ratio scale data : the data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero.\n",
    "                    eg: Students marks in class\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an\n",
    "    example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans. From identifying the level of measurement, researchers can determine how data was collected, \n",
    "     e.g. were the methods qualitative or quantitative, how the data can be classified and what type of statistical      tests can be used.\n",
    "eg.\n",
    "    For instance, continuous data allows researchers to carry out a correlational analysis. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Ordinal data is data that can be ranked or ordered. \n",
    "        Examples include data taken from a poll or survey. \n",
    "     Nominal data is data that can be made to fit various categories. \n",
    "        Examples include whether an animal is a mammal, fish, reptile, amphibian, or bird.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Dot plot \n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each\n",
    "type of statistics and explain how they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  descriptive statistics focus on describing the visible characteristics of a dataset.  Meanwhile, inferential statistics focus on making predictions or generalizations about a larger dataset, based on a sample of those data\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain\n",
    "how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three commonly used measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. A statistic that tells us how the data values are dispersed or spread out is called the measure of dispersion."
